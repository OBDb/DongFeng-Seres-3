    description: "The DongFeng Seres 3 (also known as the SF5 in some markets) is a compact all-electric SUV from the Chinese manufacturer. Built on a dedicated EV platform, it features modern crossover styling with clean lines, LED lighting elements, and a coupe-like sloping roofline. The exterior design emphasizes aerodynamic efficiency while maintaining SUV proportions with a relatively high ride height. Powered by a single or dual electric motor setup depending on the variant, with the higher-performance versions producing around 347 HP and 516 lb-ft of torque in dual-motor configuration, enabling 0-100 km/h acceleration in approximately 4.7 seconds. The lithium-ion battery pack provides a range of approximately 300-500 km (186-310 miles) depending on the specific model and test cycle. The interior features a minimalist, technology-focused design with a large central touchscreen (typically 10.25-15.6 inches depending on the market and model year), a digital instrument cluster, and a clean dashboard layout with minimal physical buttons. Standard features include advanced driver assistance systems, wireless smartphone integration, and over-the-air update capability. Some markets offer an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) variant that combines an electric powertrain with a small gasoline engine acting as a generator. The Seres 3 represents China's growing presence in the global electric vehicle market, offering competitive specifications and technology at a price point that challenges established manufacturers."
